#Project-Plannit


Project Description: 

Plannit is a website that aims to bring people together online, and in-person.
Users will be able to create or join a party centered around a specific activity. 
Some examples of typical users would be students, gamers, and athletes. 
For example, if a student would like to create a study session for calculus 1,
the student can create a public post stating a time and place(if applicable) where the event will occur. 
When users create or join an event, they will receive a notification confirming their action. 
Users searching to join events will be able to sort the postings through a variety of ways,
such as by most recent, location, group size, and whether the event is in-person or online.
Users who choose to join events will click a button to join the event, 
which will then reveal more information about the event, such as how to contact the host.
