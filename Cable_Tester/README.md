# KGB_Cable_Tester


Due to the non-disclosure agreement made with KGB aviations, I cannot share any work that me and my team have done for this project.  


Project Description: 

A cable tester for a custom device (DART) created by KGB Aviations which can be accessed through a secure web portal.

It connects to a Flight Data Recorder (FDR) or Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) to download the data.

Acts as a secure tool to transfer the data over wireless/wired networks.

Rugged design ensures that DART will operate properly in the harshest environments.

We designed a Cable Tester to work alongside DART for accurate on-field measurements.

It allows for cables with up to 80 pins to be tested for proper connectivity.

Supports Loop Testing and Normal Testing.
